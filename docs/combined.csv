American business executive; late father, James Martial Lapeyre, was the inventor of the world's first automated shrimp peeling machine; the invention revolutionized the shrimp processing industry. This led to the founding of Laitram in 1949. James Martial Lapeyre built the business over the next four decades until his death in 1989, earning 191 patents in the United States and establishing three additional operating divisions. Lapeyre graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Texas and subsequently graduated with an MBA and JD in Law from Tulane University in 1978, before joining the family business, Laitram, in 1979, as an in-house lawyer.

Over the next decade, Lapeyre became a Division Consultant and built a core management team and continued to expand the business; Laitram posted annual revenues of $30 million with $9 million in debt in 1989.

Reportedly, he caught and sold fish in the market, sold products door to door, and started a day camp. , Lapeyre started majoring in English at University of Texas, but the course became too hard for him, which led to Lapeyre dropping the subject for History, in favour of Liberal Arts, believing that it would be a better path to a career in business. In an interview, Lapeyre had stated that the hardest part of his role as CEO and President was losing money in the early years of him joining Laitram. He also struggled emotionally when making decisions to fire   people who did not fit in with the skills or the company culture.  , In the early days of Laitram, although Lapeyre's father started the business, members of his extended family had reportedly invested and owned over 80% of the business. This led to Lapeyre being unsure whether business would be the right career path for him.  , Reportedly, Lapeyre chose the University of Texas to further his studies due to the fact that it was the best academic offer he had, going there on a basketball scholarship. He wasn't good enough for starting the games at the university, which led to him being in the reserve team for four years. Lapeyre's advice to young people who want to become leaders is, ""Work with people you trust and respect and think carefully about the kind of person you want to be. You can look at traits you respect and admire in others. Make that trait or habit part of you. You're not trying to be like that person but to learn a skill or habit.

" David Robert Filo is alive. David Robert Filo was born on 1966-04-20, who is currently 58 years old, is married and identifies as male.  Moss Bluff, Louisiana-native earned a Master's degree from Stanford University in Electrical Engineering and registered for his Ph.D. at the university. While pursuing his Ph.D. Filo co-founded, along with fellow doctoral student Jerry Yang, ""Jerry and Dave's Guide to the World Wide Web,"" an online navigation guide, in 1994. The duo took a leave of absence from the Ph.D. program and in 1995, they incorporated the company as Yahoo!, an acronym for ""Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle."" Filo served as a Director from 1995 to 1996. In 1996, they took the company public. Over the years, Yahoo! has teamed up with Reuters to provide news and started popular enhancements such as ""My Yahoo"" and ""Yahooligans."" In 2008, Microsoft made a bid to acquire Yahoo! at $31 a share, valuing the company at $44.6 billion; the bid was rejected. In April 2014, Filo was appointed a Director of Yahoo!. and he served as Chief Yahoo. Filo was also a key technologist and directs the technical operations of Yahoo!'s global network of web properties. In July 2016, Yahoo! agreed to sell its operating business to American broadband telecommunications company, Verizon Communications for around $4.83 billion in cash. In January 2017, Yahoo! announced the sale of its operating business to Verizon Communications for $4.48 billion, and the remaining company assets operate as an investment company renamed as Altaba. In the same month, Filo resigned as a Director of Yahoo!. Currently, he is a shareholer of Altaba and serves as the President of Yellow Chair Foundation. Fortune fluctuates with the performance of Altaba and with the broad equity and bond markets. David Robert Filo is the Co-founder of The Skyline Foundation. They are a confirmed ultra-high-net-worth individual. Some interesting facts about David Robert Filo are: Filo was named on ""50 Most Important People on the Web"" by PC World in 2007. On reflecting on his career, Filo said, ""We're not in this for the fast money. Really, what we want is to be part of this industry."" His skill in the industry was recognized with the ""Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur"" award in 1997. In 2008, Microsoft made a bid to acquire Yahoo! at $31 a share, valuing the company at $44.6 billion; in 2013, Yahoo!'s market value stood at $32.1 billion. The reduction in market value has been traced to the fact that Yahoo! reduced its number of outstanding shares by selling part of its ownership to Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce website. Reportedly 75% of Yahoo!'s market value is linked to its stake in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan and any movement in the stock price is closely linked to the fact that Yahoo! may be able to raise money from its stakes in those businesses and not because of its core business. Filo supports educational causes, both personally and through his foundation. Along with his wife, Angela, and other Silicon Valley influencers, Filo helped fund the K12 Start Fund, which aims to increase early funding for education technology companies. In the early 1990s, Filo and Jerry Yang were pursuing their doctorates in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. In 1993, when their faculty adviser was on sabbatical in Italy, the pair began fooling around with the World Wide Web. They came up with the idea to provide a road map for online users. They designed software that organized web pages into topics that could be used immediately to link to those pages and thus created ""Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web,"" which was later renamed ""Jerry and Dave's Guide to the World Wide Web."" The two provided the service free to all Stanford users. As the users grew, they began subdividing the topics to provide more structure. Later they renamed it ""Yahoo!."" By November 1994, there were 170,000 people using the site and by 1998, the number had increased to 26 million unique visitors and 1 billion hits a month. America Online (AOL), Microsoft and Prodigy offered a buy-out. At the beginning of 1995, Stanford University asked them to move the company off campus as Yahoo! was tying up their network with all the traffic. By April 1995, the partners had left the Stanford campus, accepted a $1 million investment from Sequoia Capital, and set up their office space. By August 1995, Yahoo! began selling advertising space on their web page and in the same month they teamed up with the U.K.-based Reuters news service. , Yahoo! formerly owned a Dassault Falcon 2000-202 and a Cessna Citation Excel-560-5308. Filo earned a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University and registered for his Ph.D. in the same department. While pursuing his doctorate, he co-founded Yahoo! with Jerry Yang, a fellow doctoral student. He is currently on a leave of absence from Stanford's Ph.D. program. Yahoo! is an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchic Officious Oracle. Co-Founders, Yang and Filo, said they picked the name out of a dictionary and added, ""We thought it fit well with what we were doing. It was irreverent. It was reflective of the Wild West nature of the Internet. A lot of people found it easy to remember, and besides, it's exactly what me and Jerry are. A couple of yahoos."".

He formed Buffett Partnership with his father-in-law, his college roommate, his mother, aunt, sister, brother-in-law and his lawyer; Buffett contributed only $100 of his own money to the partnership. More and more investors started putting in their money into the partnership. Graham-Newman Corporation was being liquidated at the same time, and Benjamin Graham, directed investors of Graham-Newman to go to Buffett, which in turn helped his company grow. When the partnership was dissolved, investors, including Buffett, experienced a thirty-fold gain in their value per share. , In 2013, Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital acquired Kraft Heinz, a food company known for its ketchup and baked beans, for a reported $28 billion. , In 2016, Berkshire Hathaway had bought Apple stock worth $1 billion. Buffett reportedly saves money on taxes paid to the government of the United States. Buffett has a keen sense of the stock market. One of his investments includes the American Express. He bought American Express, when it was on an all-time low, when it had lent in excess to Allied Crude Vegetable Oil, which was caught in the salad oil scandal. He bought the stock for $12 million and it is now worth more than $7.8 billion. , In March 2014, David Winters, the CEO of Wintergreen Advisers, a New York-based money manager company, which holds 2.5 million shares in a beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company, launched a public campaign against Coca-Cola's employee stock plan. He then asked Buffett to oppose it. But Buffett, who holds a stake in Coca-Cola, through Berkshire Hathaway, abstained from a vote on the proposal, for which Winters alleged that Buffett might have planned to buy out Coca-Cola with private equity group 3G Capital. However, Buffett denied any plans to privatize the company. Buffett and his late ex-wife, Susan, separated in 1977, but remained friends and even vacationed together occasionally. She met Astrid Menks at a restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska, and the two women soon became friends. Later, Susan introduced Astrid to Buffett. The three became quite close, even sent Christmas gifts to relatives signed as ""Warren, Susie, and Astrid."", In an op-ed piece for The New York Times, Buffett urged the United States lawmakers to raise taxes on Americans making more than $1 million, to help reduce the budget deficit. This new rule came to be known as the 'Buffett Rule'. In 2010, he paid $6.9 million in federal taxes. For introducing the new rule, Buffett received the 'Presidential Medal of Freedom,' from Barack Obama, the former President of the United States at the White House in Washington, D.C. While talking in an interview, Buffett reportedly admitted that he drinks at least five cans of The Coca-Cola Company a day, enjoys chocolate-chip ice cream for breakfast, and often carries a tube of Potato Stix around with him. When asked for the reason behind this diet, he said ""I checked the actuarial tables, and the lowest death rate is among six-year-olds,' so I decided to eat like a six-year-old. It's the safest course I can take."", Buffett is nicknamed and often referred to as the ""Oracle of Omaha."" He has also been referred as the ""Sage of Omaha."", Buffett reportedly made his first earnings at the age of six by selling packs of gum purchased from his grandfather's grocery store to the neighbors door-to-door. Buffett shared an instance with the writer, Alice Schroeder, which was mentioned in her book, 'The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life' that he said, ""I remember a woman named Virginia Macoubrie saying, 'I'll take one stick of Juicy Fruit,' and I said, We don't break up packs of gum. I've got my principles. No, they were sold only in five-stick packs. They were a nickel, and she wanted to spend a penny with me."", In an interview, Buffett stated that until the age of 20, he was afraid of public speaking and was finding it difficult to say his name in a crowd. Talking about his experience he said, ""Just the thought of it made me physically ill, I would literally throw up."" Adding to that, in college he selected courses where he did not have to stand in front of a crowd. While at Columbia Business School, he saw the advertisement of the Dale Carnegie public speaking course and signed up for the course. The second time around, he went to the instructor and paid him $100 in cash for the course and said, ""I knew if I gave him the cash I'd show up.""

Buffett crediting the course for his success and said, ""I don't have my diploma from the University of Nebraska hanging on my office wall, and I don't have my diploma from Columbia up there either - but I do have my Dale Carnegie graduation certificate proudly displayed. It's certainly had the biggest impact in terms of my subsequent success."", Buffett believes in holding on to the values he grew up with. He still lives in a house which he bought in 1958 and drives his own car. He does not like showing off his fortune.

He stated, ""The world has changed for the airlines. And I don't know how it's changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way. I don't know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period. I think there are certain industries, and unfortunately, I think that the airline industry, among others, that are really hurt by a forced shutdown by events that are far beyond our control."", In March 2022, Berkshire Hathaway, where Buffett serves as the Chairman and CEO, signed an agreement to acquire Alleghany Corporation, a New York-based insurance and investment operating company, for $11.6 billion.

According to the deal, Berkshire Hathaway received preferred stock worth $5 billion with 6% of dividend paid annually. The company also received warrants for 700 million shares that can be exercised at any time with a premium of 5%. In February 2014, the terms of the agreement were planned to be changed to seek favor of the regulators towards the investment, which allowed the bank to consider preferred shares, which were worth $2.9 billion as Tier 1 capital, and also it had to wait for at least five years to redeem the preferred stock. This amendment was yet to be approved by Bank of America's shareholders. In 2013, Berkshire Hathaway planned to buy a beverage-dispensing machine business, IMI, for more than $1 billion.

He still says that he would have made even more money if he had rented the house and used the purchase money to buy stocks. Buffett's love for investing in textile brands is shrewd; he invests in products he actually uses. He invested, through Berkshire Hathaway, in Fruit of the Loom, because he enjoyed wearing their shirts and underwear. His taste in wearing a specific brand of suit led him to invest in Trands Company, a Chinese firm. He made a video commemorating Trands Company's 30th anniversary, and sported nine Trands suits in the video. Reportedly has not spent a dime for his wardrobe.

When former United States President Barack Obama proposed tax changes on foreign-derived earnings, Ballmer stated, ""It makes United States jobs more expensive, we're better off taking lots of people and moving them out of the United States as opposed to keeping them inside the United States."", Speaking about Microsoft's philosophy of philanthropy, Ballmer once said, ""I don't start with what are we giving away but what are we trying to accomplish and what can we get done."" When asked about his own charitable contributions, Ballmer, who prefers to maintain his privacy and anonymity in that realm, said, ""My own world's my own world, so I continue to treat it that way; if you stack it up next to the world's problems, it's got to be money that ignites action."", In May 2014, Ballmer was among the bidders seeking to purchase the American professional basketball team, the Los Angeles Clippers, from co-owners Rochelle Sterling and her husband Donald Sterling; the latter faced a lifetime ban from the National Basketball Association (NBA) over racist remarks he made.

He graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and economics in 1977. He then entered the Stanford University Graduate School of Business MBA program in 1979 but dropped out in 1980 to join Microsoft. In 2013, Microsoft purchased Nokia's Devices &amp; Services business, which allowed the company to increase its presence in the hardware business. The purchase was initiated by Ballmer and was outside of Microsoft's traditional expertise. There were huge job cuts in the acquired business, raising questions about Microsoft's plans in the market for mobile devices. The deal has been unpopular with investors and many people inside Microsoft. During Ballmer's tenure, Microsoft was often criticized for layers of bureaucracy and expensive initiatives. During the transition period preceding Ballmer's naming as CEO of Microsoft, he was said to have had a lot of free time and did not want to make any plans until the transition was complete. He reportedly watched CBS's hit sitcom ""The Good Wife"" to pass time, binge-viewing 100 episodes in two weeks' time on his Microsoft Surface tablet. His kids would ridicule him, asking, ""Dad, how's the wife?"", Ballmer was the best man at Bill Gates' wedding in 1994. In October 2015, Ballmer revealed that he had bought a 4% stake in San Francisco, California-based online social networking company Twitter. He does not appear to continue to hold the shares. In 2006, Ballmer was named an honorary citizen of Lausen, Switzerland, from where his father had emigrated to the United States. In September 2019, Ballmer reportedly invested $100 million in the city of Inglewood, California, where the Los Angeles Clippers are aiming to move. In October 2019, The Madison Square Garden Company (MSG) filed a lawsuit to prevent Ballmer from building a new arena for the Los Angeles Clippers claiming that the venue for the new arena would cut the concert and event business of their indoor stadium, The Forum. In March 2020, Ballmer bought The Forum from MSG in an all-cash deal valued at $400 million. With the purchase of the stadium, the litigation involving Ballmer and MSG would be resolved. It was reported that The Forum would continue to operate as a live-music venue. In September 2021, the Los Angeles Clippers signed a $500 million sponsorship deal with Mountain View, California-based software company, Intuit, for their new arena, scheduled to open in 2024. The new arena would be known as Intuit Dome. In 2002, Fredric Alan Maxwell wrote an unauthorized biography of Ballmer entitled, ""Bad Boy Ballmer: The Man Who Rules Microsoft."", In August 2014, Ballmer introduced himself to the Los Angeles Clippers fans and celebrated his new ownership of the National Basketball Association (NBA) team. Ballmer made his entrance through the crowd at the Staples Centre with Eminem's ""Lose Yourself"" as background music. He was seen giving high fives and chest-bumping fans before he took center stage. He addressed 4,500 fans and assured them that the team would not move to Seattle, Washington. He told them, ""I love Los Angeles. Yes, I live in Seattle. We're not moving the Clippers to Seattle for a hundred reasons."" He also made a bold statement that the team would win many Larry's in the coming years, referring to the Larry O'Brien trophy, the championship trophy awarded annually by the NBA to the winner of the league championship. In May 2021, Second Spectrum agreed to be acquired by United Kingdom-based sports analytics company, Genius Sports, in a deal valued at $200 million. , In April 2017, Ballmer started USAFacts.org, a website that collects government data from 70 different government sources and creates a financial report on the government, which is available for everyone.

Some interesting facts about Sheldon Gary Adelson are: Adelson served in the U.S. Army in the 1950s, later worked as a court reporter on Wall Street. He also worked as a mortgage broker, investment advisor and financial consultant early in his career. In 2012, Las Vegas Sands was part of a federal investigation into possible violations of U.S. money-laundering laws. The investigation aimed to discover whether the firm's casinos were used to launder money for several individuals engaged in illegal activities in North America. In August 2013, Las Vegas Sands agreed to pay $47.4 million to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, after it failed to report money transfers made by a Chinese-Mexican businessman and gambler, Zhenli Ye Gon, who faced drug-trafficking charges in Mexico. In March 2014, Las Vegas Sands reportedly requested of Singapore authorities more land to add 1,500 additional rooms to the 2,563-room resort Marina Bay Sands. It also planned to add meeting rooms, ballrooms and exhibition spaces to the resort, which currently includes 1.2 million square feet of meeting and convention space and two theaters for Broadway shows, concerts and gala events. , In January 2012, Asian American Entertainment Corp (AAEC) filed a lawsuit against three of Las Vegas Sands' subsidiaries LVS (Nevada) International Holdings Incorporated, Las Vegas Sands LLC and Venetian Casino Resort LLC. The plaintiff claims $11.94 billion in damages citing the alleged breach of agreements while Las Vegas Sands successfully bid for a casino license in Macau in 2012. The damages claimed comprise of the alleged loss in profits faced by AAEC from 2004 to 2018 and 70 percent of profits up to 2022, when Las Vegas Sands' Macau casino license expires. The first hearing of the case is due in September 2019; the case appears to be ongoing. In February 2014, Adelson announced plans to invest around $10 billion to open casinos in Japan. This investment was said to be the first of its type in Japan, where such gambling had long been illegal. In December 2015, Adelson purchased Las Vegas, Nevada-based major daily newspaper publication the Las Vegas Review-Journal for $140 million.

Adelson reportedly planned to build ""Eurovegas,"" a vast complex of casinos, hotels and conference centers on the outskirts of Madrid, which would boost the Spanish economy by creating thousands of construction jobs. According to Adelson, Spanish anti-smoking laws, which prohibit lighting up in public areas, were a stumbling block and held up the project. In June 2013, he appealed to the ruling PP party to lift the law. The project appears to have been abandoned in December 2013. In July 2014, Adelson, along with Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and Bill Gates, Founder of Microsoft, criticized the U.S. Congress over its failure to revamp immigration laws. In an op-ed published in the New York Times, they wrote, ""The three of us vary in our politics and would differ also in our preferences about the details of an immigration reform bill. But we could without a doubt come to together to draft a bill acceptable to each of us and it's time this brand of thinking finds its way to Washington."" The three put forth the opinion that the U.S. should enact immigration legislation that would favor both immigrants living in U.S. and take into account the well-being of U.S. citizens. The op-ed appears to have been prompted by the refusal of House Speaker John Boehner to rally his party's members in Congress to pass an immigration reform bill submitted to that body by President Barack Obama. In March 2017, Las Vegas Sands reportedly agreed to sell Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem, one of its hotel and casino unit in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to Las Vegas, Nevada-based hospitality and entertainment company MGM Resorts International for approximately $1.3 billion.

The case was later dismissed. , In February 2014, certain websites of Las Vegas Sands and its affiliates over the world including Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Macau and Singapore, and the company's corporate website, were reportedly hacked, publicly displaying a list of social security numbers, e-mail addresses and job titles of some of its employees.

It's a big iron pipe with a hunk of lead on the head. I think about how far we've come as companies from those days, where workers had to protect themselves from the company. My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they're having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society. As a world, we're doing a better job of that. My goal is for Google to lead, not follow that."", On January 20, 2023, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, where Page is a co-founder, announced massive lay-offs affecting 12,000 of their employees, approximately 6% of the full-time workforce.

The duo later dropped out from the Ph.D. program in 1995 to establish the company as Yahoo!.

Yang was subsequently replaced by Carol Bartz as the CEO of Yahoo! in January 2009. In 1993, Yang attended a six-month teaching assistant program in Kyoto, Japan. The program was intended to create an opportunity for Stanford University's students to study at the Stanford Center for Technology and Innovation (SCTI) in Japan. There, he met his wife, Akiko Yamazaki, who was also a student at Stanford University. In 2005, when Yang served as the CEO of Yahoo!, the company invested $1 billion for a 40% stake in Alibaba. Yahoo! profited from the deal, when it sold half of that stake back to Alibaba for $6.3 billion in cash, $800 million in preferred, and an additional cash payment of $550 million for intellectual property and other considerations. In 1997, Yang made his first trip to China. Yun Ma, also known as ""Jack Ma"", a junior staffer in the economics ministry was assigned to take Yang on a tour of the Great Wall of China. Along the hike, the two hit it off and talked about the growth of the Web. Yang recalled, ""Jack was one of the first people I ever met [in China]. He was very curious about what it's like on the Internet and what the future might be."" Ma had tried and failed to start a Chinese version of the Yellow Pages. Several months later, Ma began another startup called the Alibaba Group. Yang was born in Taiwan. His father passed away when he was two years old. His family migrated to San Jose, California when he was 10. The only English word that Yang reportedly knew when he arrived in the United States, was ""shoe."" In the next three years, he became fluent in English and was even enrolled in the Advanced Placement English class. In the early 1990s, David Filo and Yang were pursuing their Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering at Stanford University. In 1993, when their faculty advisor was on a sabbatical in Italy, the duo began exploring the World Wide Web and came up with the idea to provide a road map for online users. They designed software that organized web pages into topics that could be used immediately to link to those pages and thus created ""Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web,"" which was later renamed ""Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web."" The two provided the service free of cost to all Stanford users. With the increasing number of users, they began subdividing the topics to provide more structure and renamed it ""Yahoo!."" By November 1994, there were 170,000 users and by 1998, the number increased to 26 million unique visitors and 1 billion hits a month. In 1995, Stanford University asked them to move the company out of campus as Yahoo! was tying up their network with all the traffic.

" Pierre Morad Omidyar is alive. Pierre Morad Omidyar was born on 1967-06-21, who is currently 56 years old, is married and identifies as male. Born in Paris, France, to parents from Iran, Omidyar emigrated to the United States with his family. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Tufts University and shortly thereafter joined Claris, a subsidiary of Apple Computer that developed software for the Macintosh. In 1991, he co-founded Ink Development, a developer of software for online commerce, which was later renamed eShop; and worked there as a Software Engineer until 1994. He then worked as a Software Engineer for General Magic. In 1995, Omidyar established AuctionWeb, an online auction website, which was reportedly launched to help his wife collect Pez Dispensers. It became an online platform on which other users could also auction their own collectibles. It gained popularity by word of mouth and in 1997 it was renamed eBay; the company went public in 1998. Omidyar served as the Chairman of eBay from May 1996 to July 2015. In 2010, he established Honolulu Civil Beat, a news organization in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he serves as the CEO. He is a Partner of the Omidyar Group, a non-profit organization which consists of the Democracy Fund, Omidyar Network, HopeLab, Humanity United and the Ulupono Initiative. The organization's philanthropic supports various causes including entrepreneurship, human rights, food and energy, and games and technology. He also established First Media Look, a non-profit media organization, which was started with Omidyar's own investment of $250 million in 2013. Currently, Omidyar is a Director Emeritus of eBay and is the CEO and Publisher of First Media Look. Fortune fluctuates with the share price of eBay and PayPal, and with broad equity and bond markets. Pierre Morad Omidyar is the Honorary Director of eBay. They are a confirmed ultra-high-net-worth individual. Some interesting facts about Pierre Morad Omidyar are: Omidyar moved to Maryland as a child when his father accepted a residency at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center. At the age of 14, he wrote his first computer program to catalog books for the school library. Omidyar was reportedly never tempted to blow any of his fortune on a buying spree. Speaking about his wealth, Omidyar said, ""We sort of skipped the 'regular rich' and we went straight to 'ridiculous rich.' I had the notion that, OK, so now we have all of this wealth, we could buy not only one expensive car, we could buy all of them. As soon as you realize that you could buy all of them, then none of them are particularly interesting or satisfying."" So, he decided to make an impact on society through philanthropy, carving out his own philanthropic strategies. Speaking on philanthropy, he reportedly said, ""Don't leave your business hat at the door. Philanthropy today is not what it was 30 years ago. Using the tools of business and using for-profit approaches to have a social impact is definitely part of the ballgame today."", Omidyar, in preparation for a potential catastrophe, has reportedly stocked personal emergency food at a storage facility near his home in Honolulu, Hawaii. He also owns a 640-acre self-sufficient ranch in Montana called Reed Point Ranch, to which he and his family can retreat in case of an emergency. In January 2014, Carl Icahn, an eBay shareholder, approached Omidyar to spin-off PayPal, which was then an eBay subsidiary, but Omidyar rejected the proposal. In March 2014, Icahn proposed to elect two employees of Icahn Enterprises, Jonathan Christodoro and Daniel Ninivaggi, to the board of eBay. However, eBay rejected the two nominees, stating that the candidates did not have the relevant expertise or experience to serve on the board of eBay; and that adding them as directors would have violated guidelines on ""overboarding,"" as the two were already on the boards of four other publicly listed firms. Subsequently, Icahn softened his pressure on the shareholders of eBay to spin-off PayPal completely, but urged eBay to sell a stake of 20% in PayPal through an initial public offering. In April 2014, Icahn backed-off from his proposal to spin-off PayPal as he could not gather support from other major shareholders of the company. Icahn also withdrew his two nominees to eBay's board. In February 2014, eBay acquired the computer graphics firm PhiSix Fashion Labs for an undisclosed price. PhiSix Fashion Labs boasts an innovative technology system that allows online apparel buyers to try an item of clothing on virtually before purchasing; it also suggests clothing sizes based on measurements provided by shoppers. Omidyar reportedly owns undeveloped resort properties in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and Sonoma, California. In 2013, Omidyar was struggling to find the right strategy for creating a viable mass-market media business, to compete against Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos' Washington Post. In October 2013, he backed a new media venture called First Look Media with at least $250 million. In 1999, when eBay suffered service disruptions and was down for more than 22 hours, Omidyar and the company's CEO called their top 10,000 users to personally apologize for the inconvenience. Omidyar's avatar in online virtual game ""Second Life"" is a bald, tribal-tattooed, muscle-shirt-wearing black man named ""Kitto Mandala."" It was reported that, in the mid-2000s, Omidyar had been so actively involved in the game, that he adopted the secret identity of Kitto Mandala, and Philip Rosedale, the Founder of Second Life's developer Linden Lab, use to interact with his animated avatar most of the time. In 2011, Omidyar was honored with an Honorary Doctor of Public Services degree by Tufts University. Omidyar is reportedly worried that the wealth he has accumulated might warp his children. On the topic, he said, ""Either you get rid of every cent before your kid reaches 4, or you acknowledge that something different has happened and try to raise him with a sense of obligation."", While working at General Magic, Omidyar created a simple auction prototype on his personal web page, and later launched an online service called AuctionWeb as a sole proprietorship in 1995, to help sell his wife Pamela's Pez dispensers. The web page also allowed other members to auction collectibles on the platform. The first item sold on the site was, however, not a Pez dispenser, but a broken laser pointer. Omidyar was astonished that anyone would buy a broken device. Similar surprises followed. The business exploded as correspondents began to register and trade goods of an unimaginable variety. He charged a small fee of 25 cents and $2 to sellers for posting their auction notice, and took a small percentage of the sale, which financed the expansion of the site. The revenue soon outstripped his salary at General Magic, and Omidyar decided to dedicate his full attention to his new enterprise. Business expanded through word of mouth, and AuctionWeb added a Feedback Forum, allowing buyers and sellers to rate each other for honesty and reliability. From collectibles, the site quickly expanded into a vast range of salable items, including furniture, electronics, home appliances, cars and other vehicles. In 1996, Omidyar signed a licensing deal to offer airline tickets online. In 1996, AuctionWeb hosted 250,000 auctions. In 1997, it hosted 2 million. By the middle of that year, the company, renamed eBay, was hosting nearly 800,000 auctions a day. Omidyar has been recognized by many groups and organizations, and been named among the world's leading philanthropists by various publications. In 1999, Omidyar received the ""U.S. National Entrepreneur of the Year Award,"" from Ernst &amp; Young. He was listed among the Global Leaders of Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum in 1999. Has also been honored with the ""Visionary of the Year Award,"" by Software Development Forum; and the ""Global Leaders of Tomorrow,"" by the World Economic Forum.

American investment manager; Fink earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he also earned an MBA. In 1976, Fink joined The First Boston Corporation, where he eventually served as the Managing Director. In 1988, Fink co-founded BlackRock which was acquired by The PNC Financial Services Group in 1995. In 1999, BlackRock went public with PNC as the majority shareholder.

Majority of fortune fluctuates with the broad equity and bond markets; remainder fluctuates with the performance of BlackRock. Laurence Douglas Fink is the Chairman and CEO of BlackRock. They are a confirmed ultra-high-net-worth individual. Some interesting facts about Laurence Douglas Fink are: Fink's property in North Salem, New York boasts an indoor riding ring and an 18th-century manor house containing a collection of American folk art. In 2007, Fink received the John E. Anderson Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In April 2010, he was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship, and in March 2016, he received the UCLA medal from his alma mater, in recognition of his services to the community and his successful career in business and finance. Fink reportedly wakes up by 5.15 AM and gets ready for a 5:45 AM car ride that will drop him minutes later at BlackRock's headquarters. He has his breakfast in his office, which typically consists of cereal with blueberries and bananas; his lunch will normally be at a restaurant, over a business meeting. He has business dinners at least three nights a week. He returns home by 6.30 PM in the evening, reads the news, and goes to bed at 10.30 PM. In 2010, it was reported that when BlackRock was awarded key government contracts with no competitive bidding, questions were raised about Fink's long-standing relationships with senior government officials, particularly former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Tim Geithner, Henry's successor. Fink joined The First Boston Corporation in 1976, and quickly became one of the first mortgage-backed securities traders on Wall Street. He structured some of its landmark deals and became the youngest Managing Director in the company's history. And then, in the second quarter of 1986, his department lost $100 million, after they made a bad bet on interest rates. Because of that, almost overnight, Fink has said, that he went ""from a star to a jerk."" When he left the company in 1988, there were reports that his departure was forced by the company, though Fink has insisted that he was not fired. He has said, ""It was very painful. I was not treated as a partner or with the dignity that I expected. Relationships changed and that was difficult for me to handle. As a result, I was losing my self-confidence."", Fink served on the CEO Steering Committee of the 'Campaign to Fix the Debt,' a nonpartisan movement to improve the fiscal and economic state in the United States. It is unclear if he continues to serve on the committee. Some of the companies where BlackRock reportedly holds a stake have a bad track record. Some of the companies have been accused of bribery, child labour, causing damages to the environment etc. Fink's father reportedly owned a shoe store and his mother was an English professor in Van Nuys, California. Fink helped his father in his footwear business at the age of 10. In an interview, he said, ""I wasn't aware of it at the time, but what I learned was an ability to communicate at a young age and responsibility."", In 2019, a fake letter from Fink was released by 'Yes Men,' a group of pranksters with a history of embarrassing big companies announcing the BlackRock's plans to no longer invest in companies that are not compliant with the Paris Agreement, an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, dealing with greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance, signed in 2016. The hoax was carried out as a means to criticize BlackRock's ownership in 2.1 billion tonnes of thermal coal reserves, based on the size of its stakes in major miners. In September 2019, BlackRock opened an office in Saudi Arabia. The plans to open an office there were announced in 2017 as Saudi Arabia began seeking investors to support its push to diversify the economy away from oil. Saudi Arabia is reportedly looking to partner with BlackRock on a $20 billion global infrastructure fund. Fink was reportedly considered for the role of the United States Treasury Secretary in the past. Reportedly, the administration under the former United States President, Barrack Obama had him on the shortlist to replace Timothy Geithner as the Treasury Secretary. Fink has hired several former members of the United States Treasury Department into high-level positions at BlackRock, which, reports suggest, would have improved the prospects of him becoming the Treasury Secretary, if the then-Democratic Party's presidential front-runner, Hillary Clinton had become the President of the United States. Fink has reportedly been a prominent Democratic donor, and he is said to be close to Obama. In a letter Fink issued to CEOs of S&amp;P 500 companies [the S&amp;P 500 is a stock market index which comprises of common stocks issued by 500 mid and large-cap companies and traded on American stock exchanges, and covers about 75% of the American equity market by capitalization] and large European corporations in January 2016, he advocated long-termism; he urged companies to focus on creating long-term value instead of emphasizing quarterly targets, and ignore activist shareholders and others looking for a quick boost to shares. He also included a message for the United States Government, saying that it was just as much to blame for short-termism as the corporate world. Specifically, Fink advocated for extending the definition of long-term capital gains to at least three years, and gradually dropping the taxes payable on such income after that. Reportedly, his tax proposal mirrored Hillary Clinton's views; Clinton also embraced Fink's views on short-termism, which raised speculation that he may have been angling for the job of Treasury Secretary if Clinton had become the President. Over the years BlackRock has settled few cases with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

On October 24, 2012, Ocwen Financial and Walter Investment Management jointly won a bid for the mortgage servicing and origination platform assets of Residential Capital, a subsidiary of Ally Financial, for a reported $3 billion. Talking about Residential Capital's acquisition, Erbey said, ""The acquisition of Residential Capital significantly advances Ocwen Financial's planned growth initiative to add high return servicing assets to our portfolio and to expand our servicing capacity through retention of a significant portion of Residential Capital's high quality servicing organization."" On June 5, 2012, Ocwen Financial acquired Aurora Bank's commercial servicing rights portfolio which consisted of more than 3,000 loans with a total principal balance of $1.8 billion. In January 2014, Ocwen Financial agreed to acquire around 2% of residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio from Wells Fargo, which covered more than 184,000 loans with a principal balance of more than $39 billion. In February 2014, Benjamin Lawsky, the New York Superintendent of Financial Services, who was investigating Ocwen Financial, halted the transfer of $39 billion of mortgage servicing rights to Ocwen Financial from Wells Fargo. This move resulted in the loss of the faith of investors. In November 2014, Ocwen Financial reportedly terminated the deal with Wells Fargo. Regarding his philanthropic endeavors, Erbey said, ""My wife and I don't have children, so we're giving all of our money to schools for scholarships because I really do believe that we have to get our population educated."", He is believed to be a committed worker. Lee Cooperman, the Chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, which owns shares in three companies, where Erbey has been the largest shareholder, called Erbey a ""workaholic."" Erbey was once invited by an investor to join him for shark fishing, to which Erbey responded, ""I will do it for you if you want, but I will make more money for you if I go to the office."", He is a recipient of the ""Gold Citation"" from his alma mater, Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. In 2012, Erbey and his wife, Elaine, moved to Saint Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the first year, they ran up a $2,000 electric bill. They eventually turned down the air conditioning in an effort to cut costs. Talking about Erbey's lifestyle, Orin Kramer, the Founder of hedge fund, Boston Provident said, ""He lives a lifestyle that, if he lived for 2,000 years he couldn't spend his net worth. It's one of the things that makes someone comfortable as an investor, because he's always focused on the dark side."", In 2012, Erbey moved Ocwen Financial's headquarters from Atlanta, Georgia to Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, where the tax rate is much lower. The move resulted in Ocwen Financial saving 90% on corporate income tax. Related public entities are also based in tax havens. Altisource Asset Management is based in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Altisource Portfolio Solutions and Altisource Residential Corporation are based in Luxembourg and Home Loan Servicing Solutions is headquartered in the Cayman Islands. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB), close to 9,500 homeowners had complained about how their mortgages had been serviced since 2011. In December 2013, the CFPB teamed up with authorities from 49 states and forced Ocwen Financial to settle allegations that the company improperly denied homeowners loan modifications and imposed unauthorized fees and penalties upon them. CFPB ordered the company to provide $2 billion in the form of principal loan reductions to homeowners and $127.3 million in refunds to be paid to the 185,000 people whose properties had already been foreclosed upon. Erbey is a workaholic. In 1983 and 1984, he and his wife, Elaine, reportedly worked every day but one, for two years.

" Dov A. Charney is alive. Dov A. Charney was born on 1969-01-31, who is currently 55 years old, is single and identifies as male.  Canadian native and serial entrepreneur; dropped out from Tufts University in Massachusetts. In the 1980s, while at university, Charney began smuggling Hanes T-shirts across the Canadian border. In 1990, borrowed $10,000 from his father to start an apparel company and employed twenty women to make T-shirts. One of his first creations was a 'Girly-T' shirt for girls, a sexy tight-fitting top which became a best-seller through the late 1990s and early 2000s. The line developed, from a single shirt into American Apparel, which eventually became America's largest domestic clothing manufacturer. In 2005, began selling leggings. In 2006, American Apparel was sold to Endeavor Acquisition in a shell transaction that let American Apparel began trading as a public stock. Charney stayed to run the company. However, between 2009 and 2014, American Apparel lost more than $30 million and its share price plummeted. In June 2014, Charney, who had been the subject of several sexual harassment lawsuits, at least five since the mid-2000s, was suspended by American Apparel's Board of Directors from his positions as Chairman and CEO for allegations of misconduct. In December 2014, Charney was expelled from his position of company CEO. In October 2015, American Apparel filed for bankruptcy protection to reorganize its debts. Currently, Charney appears to be working on a new clothing startup. However, details of the said venture are unclear. Resides in Los Angeles, California.  Fortune fluctuates with the broad equity and bond markets. Wealth estimate is highly speculative due to controversial information available regarding Charney's activities and earnings. Dov A. Charney is the CEO of Los Angeles Apparel. They are a confirmed very-high-net-worth individual. Some interesting facts about Dov A. Charney are: In 2008, Charney stated a magazine that, ''Fashion is about sexuality. It's hard to be fashionable and sanitize it and take the sexuality out of it. It's tasteful. It has to make you feel attractive. Sex makes you feel beautiful or handsome.'', American Apparel's stock was once traded on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $15 per share in late 2007, during which the company was valued at around $1 billion. As of September 18, 2015, its price per share was traded at $0.176. In October the same year, the company was delisted from NYSE. Reportedly tried on all American Apparel's underwear designs before they went into production. In December 2014, Charney reportedly told the media that he had $100,000 left to his name and was sleeping on a friend's couch on Manhattan's Lower East Side in New York; others claimed that he was still hanging on to his eight-bedroom, 11,000-square-foot home in Los Angeles, California. In 2008, Charney had to fire 30 employees who had been at American Apparel for at least a decade due to improper paperwork; he gave them each $30,000 worth of company stock. Charney was reportedly described as an infuriating, charming, and arrogant person. In June 2014, before he was ousted as CEO of American Apparel, he was reportedly a millionaire who dated models and celebrities; owned a house on a hill at Silver Lake, California, with a balcony overlooking the Los Angeles skyline. Reportedly bought his first car, a 1977 American Motors Green Hornet, for $350 while he was attending Tufts University. At the age of eleven, Charney started a newspaper in his Montreal, Canada, neighborhood; he contracted with an area printer to produce his weekly journal, which had about 50 subscribers and sold for 25 cents a copy. , In August 2016, media reports suggested that Charney is working on a new apparel line based in Los Angeles, California, which appears to have received funding from Hagan Capital Group, an investment firm headquartered in Roswell, Georgia. However, details of the said venture are unclear. Charney claimed to be the first student at Tufts University to own a cellular phone, which cost him about $2,200 at that time. Charney has been the subject of several sexual harassment lawsuits, all of which have settled or been dismissed, with no harassment ever proven. In 2010, Deloitte &amp; Touche, a British multinational professional services firm, resigned as the auditor for American Apparel after warning the company of material weaknesses in its internal control environment, and in the financial closing and reporting process. In June 2014, Charney was reportedly forced to resign from all his positions in American Apparel after facing a series of allegations of sexual harassment and using the company's funds for his personal use. Charney, however, accused the Board of Directors of his illegal termination and sent a letter through his attorney, demanding the company to reinstate him as the Chairman and CEO. Other investors, including Swiss investment firm, FiveT Capital, which owned a 13% stake, refused to join Charney's coalition of investors to oppose his termination. In an effort to gain control over the Board, Charney increased his stake from 27% to 43% by borrowing shares of the company, which was worth $15 million, from New York, New York-based hedge fund firm Standard General, which owned more than a 10% stake in the company. Standard General and Charney collaterally held a 42% stake and voting rights in American Apparel, enabling the hedge fund to negotiate directly with the independent directors regarding the company's future. Meanwhile, Standard General announced to pay off a $10 million loan to London, U.K.-based hedge fund firm Lion Capital, which filed a notice against American Apparel to accelerate payment of its loan amount. In March 2015, Charney reportedly claimed $40 million in damages for a breach of employment contract from American Apparel. The claims for damages included about $6 million in severance, $1.3 million in vacation time pay, about $10 million for emotional distress and 13 million shares of the company. In April 2015, American Apparel's shareholders, Jan Willem Hubner and Eric Ribner, who are known well to Charney, filed a lawsuit against one of the company's Board of Directors, Allan Mayer and David Danziger for being responsible for Charney's ouster from the clothing company. The plaintiffs accused John Luttrell, the then CFO, for staging Charney's firing for alleged misconduct, in order to sell the company as Charney was against their decision. The plaintiffs also sought to have the election invalidated and recast and the defendants currently on the Board to be removed. In June 2015, American Apparel obtained a temporary restraining order against Charney that prevented him from seeking the removal of the company's Board Members and making negative statements in the press against the company or its employees. The order expired in July. American Apparel appointed Paula Schneider as its new CEO in December. Eventually, the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 2015. The deal reportedly wiped out all current shareholders, including Charney's, and put the company's creditors in full control. In November 2016, American Apparel filed for bankruptcy protection a second time and Gildan Activewear agreed to acquire the clothing brand for $66 million. According to certain media reports, Charney filmed himself having intercourse with models and retail associates of American Apparel, and stored the videos on the company's servers. In his previous office at American Apparel, Charney used to keep several different items, from vintage advertisements showing bare-breasted Polynesian women, to a letter he wrote at age eleven asking for a refund for his not-quite-right bag of potato chips. Ernst &amp; Young named Charney ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" in 2004, while Apparel Magazine, the Fashion Industry Guild and the Ad Specialty Industry all separately deemed him ""Man of the Year."", According to various media sources, Charney used highly derogatory language in reference to his female employees and was also reported to have engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior during the course of an interview with a female reporter. During his time at Choate Rosemary Hall, a private boarding school located in Wallingford, Connecticut, American history and ethics were reportedly his favorite classes. Dov A.

" Richard A. Hayne is alive. Richard A. Hayne was born on 1947-05-26, who is currently 76 years old, is married and identifies as male.  Native of Pennsylvania, born in 1947. Richard A. Hayne, also known as Dick Hayne graduated from Lehigh University with a degree in Anthropology in 1969. In 1970, Hayne co-founded a retail company in the University of Pennsylvania campus with an initial investment of $4,000, as Free People's Store. In 1975, it moved into a 20,000 square-foot warehouse space, and was renamed to Urban Outfitters. In 1984, Hayne started the wholesale line, Free People and launched a new store concept, Anthropologie in 1992. In 1993, Urban Outfitters went public, with Hayne holding onto 35% of the stock. In 1998, Hayne imported the Urban Outfitters concept to London, U.K. with stores in Dublin, Ireland and Glasgow, Scotland. The company currently operates brands including Anthropologie, Free People, BHLDN, Terrain and Urban Outfitters. Hayne currently owns at least 19% stake in the company. He has been serving as the Chairman since inception, and as the CEO since 2012. Hayne is married to wife, Margaret Hayne. The couple appears to reside in Pennsylvania. Majority of fortune fluctuates with value of shares in Urban Outfitters; remainder fluctuates with the broad equity and bond markets. Richard A. Hayne is the Chairman and CEO of Urban Outfitters. They are a confirmed ultra-high-net-worth individual. Some interesting facts about Richard A. Hayne are: Urban Outfitters's apparel is manufactured mostly in third world countries; the company relies on domestic union labor. Speaking of a visit to the sewing and manufacturing facility of the company in India, Hayne said, ""Years ago I visited one of the factories we work with in India, and there was 500 people standing in a line three people deep stretching around the building. I said to the foreman, 'What's going on?' He told me they were all applicants for the four positions they had open. I toured that facility and it was reasonably clean, for India. And it was reasonably well-lit, again, for India. And yes, it was mostly young women working there. But it is my understanding that the only other option those women had to feed their families was selling their bodies. So I don't want to hear people from the suburbs with their fat American stomachs telling people in other countries how to run their societies"". After graduating from Lehigh University in 1969, Hayne decided to spend two years working with Eskimos in Chefornak, Alaska, under Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA). He spent his time building houses and teaching Eskimos how to speak English. Recalling the period, Hayne said, ""It was like getting an arm amputated. No TV, no radio, almost no electricity"". Speaking on his leadership style, Hayne said, ""I demand a lot of people, expect a lot from people. I like to set goals for people and then allow them to do it. Talk to them about it but try not to micromanage. I do it cooperatively I hope. I've learned over the years to never do anything in anger. I try to never bring personalities into it. It really is about business. It's not about something personal. I don't think at the Navy Yard, I can't recall times when people raise their voice and yell and scream. I don't think its productive"". Hayne has a keen interest in horticulture and gardening. In 2008, he purchased Doe Run Farm, totaling nearly 700 acres of land, which consists of three parcels bought over from different owners. The farm has a creamery and a mansion. He also purchased three greenhouses of 16,581 square feet from the University of Maryland. After the purchase of the greenhouses, the township officials gave zoning approval for the project, but notified Hayne that a state Department of Environmental Protection permit was pending. As the project work went on, the township issued a cease-and-desist order. In 2011, the Department of Environmental Protection permit arrived, and Hayne had to pay a $500 a day fine. He wound up paying a settlement check of $8,846. Urban Outfitters use renovated buildings for its stores' locations. Each store varies its displays, color schemes, cutout decorations and soundtracks. Speaking on this, Hayne said, ""Other stores will go into a mall and put their image into a space, where we use an existing space to enhance our image. None of our stores look alike. We go into these old buildings and adapt them for ourselves"". While running the store, Hayne lived in the back room of the store and showered at friends' houses. A pair of old-fashioned men's long jeans was hung on the door of Free People's Store; and during store hours the rear flap would be unbuttoned to display a sign that read ""OPEN."" The shape of the store board was shaped like a peace dove. Hayne reportedly kept long hair and openly protested the Vietnam War, but he never considered himself a hippie. Speaking on this, he said, ""I would never and did not ever characterize myself as a hippie. But it is fair to say we were influenced by the fashion of the times. So if having long hair is equated with hippiedom, then one could make that mistake. But I never called myself a 'hippie'."", Free People's Store, the predecessor of Urban Outfitters, became popular among students after it had opened. The store offered affordable clothing and accessories, and would also be used as a meeting point for hosting events. In order to keep costs low, Hayne would collect old wooden crates, as well as wooden spools which had been disposed of by power companies, and turn them into shelves and tables. Used clothes were dyed to be resold. In a 2013 interview, Hayne was asked about his influence on fashion at Urban Outfitters. He said, ""Look at me for God's sake I'm 66 years old. If I had to call what a 22-year-old girl is going to wear, it would be pathetic. I've made so many business mistakes I can warn them of traditional traps of the kinds of things they will do. No, I can't call the fashion"". After returning from Alaska, Hayne joined his Lehigh roommate Scott Belair for a drink, and came up with the idea of opening a retail store to fulfill a project that Belair had been assigned, in an entrepreneur workshop, while he was a student at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. The store targeted college students and sold inexpensive apparel and dorm room decor. The first store opened in 1970 in Philadelphia, near the University of Pennsylvania campus, and was called The Free People Store; it offered inexpensive second-hand clothing, Indian fabrics, scented candles and jewelry in a 400 square-foot space decorated with old furniture and packing crates. Urban Outfitters has often been condemned for its controversial products throughout the years. The company was accused of promoting anorexia for selling t-shirts printed ""Eat Less"" in 2008. In late 2008, Urban Outfitters started selling a t-shirt with the phrase ""I Support Same-Sex Marriage"", which was criticized, then removed from shelves; it said poor sales was the reason. The Navajo Nation, a Native American tribe, sued Urban Outfitters for violating its trademark by selling clothing and accessories using the name ""Navajo"" in February 2012. In the same year, the company released a yellow t-shirt with a six-pointed star badge which resembled the Star of David, which the Jewish people were forced to wear during the Nazi Europe. In January 2014, they were also forced to remove a top, which repeatedly printed ""Depression"" on it, after being criticized on social media. Harley-Davidson filed a lawsuit against Urban Outfitters in March 2014 for trademark violation. It is said to have violated Harley-Davidson's trademarks by reselling Harley merchandise under the ""Urban Renewal"" label without their permission. In September 2014, the company released a fake blood-stained Vintage Kent State University sweatshirt. Kent State University was home to the 1970 massacre in which four students were killed and nine others wounded by National Guard soldiers. Richard A. Hayne's Google News search terms are: Richard A.

The advertisement reportedly spurred $1 million in direct sales the next year. Plank grew up in Kensington, Maryland; he was the youngest of five brothers. He was passionate about football; he played football for the Maplewood Maple Leafs, which has appeared in a few Under Armour commercials. He was thrown out of Georgetown Preparatory School in his sophomore year for academic reasons; was recruited to play football for St. John's College High School in Northwest Washington. In September 2014, Under Armour reportedly signed a deal with super model Gisele Bundchen to promote their products aimed at women. The value of the deal and the duration of the contract were not disclosed. The partnership was announced with a release of YouTube clip video, where Bundchen was stretching in Under Armour workout gear. , In 2015, Sagamore Development, which is part of Plank Industries, acquired 230 acres of real estate in South Baltimore's Port Covington and around the Middle Branch, which included most of West Covington, the Port Covington shopping center, The Baltimore Sun printing facility, Nick's Fish House and the Baltimore Yacht Basin (BYB). He has plans to build a campus there for Under Armour. As a result of the acquisition of Baltimore Yacht Basin, the boat owners at BYB were evicted from the place. In November 2015, Montage Hotels &amp; Resorts, a California-based luxury hotel operator, was appointed to manage Plank's $60-million Recreation Pier hotel in Fell's Point, Baltimore. Plank's development company, Sagamore Development, acquired the 100-year-old pier for a reported $3.4 million in 2014. The 128-room hotel is an extension of Under Armour; the renovation would complete in 2016. Plank developed interest in horse racing as an undergraduate when he attended the Preakness, the second race of the Triple Crown, at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2007, he bought a horse breeding facility, Sagamore Farm. First win under Plank's ownership was by racehorse, Bourbon Maid, in 2007. In November 2010, a horse named Shared Account won the $2 million Breeders' Cup Fillies and Mares race. Monzon was the first Sagamore home-bred horse to participate in the Triple Crown race since Alfred Vanderbilt's stallion Native Dancer in 1953. Speaking about his horses, Plank said, ""I fundamentally believe that we'll deliver the next Triple Crown winner."" Plank has built a quarter-mile training track at Sagamore, which is made of soil, clay, and shredded bits of fabric from Under Armour t-shirts. In 2013, Plank and his wife, Desiree, purchased a 12,200-square-foot home in Washington, D.C. for $7.85 million. In February 2018, the couple listed the home for $29.5 million. In 2019, the price was lowered to $24.5 million. In June 2020, the property was sold in a deal valued at $17.25 million. In June 2012, Under Armour bought a 2012 Gulfstream G-550 with serial number 5367 and registration number N96UA from Gulfstream Aerospace. The same year it was leased to Sagamore Farm, of which Plank is the Owner. In January 2016, Under Armour bought a 2015 Citation Latitude with serial number 680A-0023 and registration number N996UA from Cessna Aircraft Company. In December 2022, Plank listed his Park City, Utah property for $21.5 million. The 6,858-square-foot property has five bedrooms and seven bathrooms. In April 2023, he relisted the property for $18.9. . Kevin Audette Plank's Google News search terms are: Kevin Audette Plank Kevin Audette Plank's religions include: Christian (Catholic).
